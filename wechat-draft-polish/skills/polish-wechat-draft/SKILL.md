# Polish WeChat Draft

## Overview

This skill helps polish existing WeChat article drafts using proven techniques from viral content analysis and authentic writing styles. It enhances titles, emotional expression, readability, and formatting while preserving the original meaning and structure.

**Important**: This skill requires an existing draft. It polishes and refines content but does not create articles from scratch.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Obtain the Draft

Request the draft content from the user if not already provided:
- "Please share the article draft you'd like me to polish"
- "I'll need to see your current draft to provide polish suggestions"

### Step 2: Analyze the Draft

Before making suggestions, understand:
- The article's core topic and key messages
- The existing structure and flow
- The current tone and style
- Target audience and purpose

### Step 3: Title Optimization

Apply techniques from [style-guide.md](references/style-guide.md):

**Include at least 2 of these 3 elements**:

1. **Strong Contrast/Paradox**
   - "Beginner" vs "Master-level results"
   - "1 minute" vs "Full day's work"
   - "Free tool" vs "Beats premium tools"

2. **Emotion-Inducing Words**
   - Positive: 神级 (god-tier), 炸裂 (mind-blowing), 逆天 (heaven-defying), 封神 (legendary)
   - Negative: 警惕 (beware), 淘汰 (eliminated), 别再 (stop doing)

3. **Authority/Specific Numbers**
   - Authority: "OpenAI官方", "哈佛教授", "行业专家"
   - Numbers: "10倍效率", "3个步骤", "1000+案例"

**Provide 3-5 title options** with explanations of which techniques each uses.

### Step 4: Content Polish

#### 4.1 Enhance Emotional Expression

Transform objective descriptions into subjective experiences using [style-guide.md](references/style-guide.md):

**From objective to emotional**:
- ❌ "This tool works well"
- ✅ "试了之后我整个人都傻了" (I was completely stunned after trying it)

**High-granularity emotional phrases**:
- "好用到哭" (so good I could cry)
- "头皮发麻" (mind-numbing)
- "整个人都傻了" (completely dumbfounded)
- "亲妈不认" (unrecognizable even to my mother)

#### 4.2 Convert to Conversational Language

Replace technical jargon with relatable analogies:
- Use metaphors and comparisons from everyday life
- Explain complex concepts as if talking to a friend
- Use "你" (you) instead of formal address
- Use "搞定" (get it done) instead of "完成" (complete)

#### 4.3 Show the Real Journey

Don't just show success - show the struggles:
- Include failed attempts
- Share moments of frustration: "结果翻车了..." (then it failed...)
- Use phrases like "那没办法，只能换别的了" (no choice but to try something else)
- Add personal details: "我本来都喝了一口茶，等着美滋滋的收一张图" (I took a sip of tea, waiting happily for the result)

#### 4.4 Add Authority and Numbers

Strategically insert:
- Specific statistics: "提升3倍效率" beats "大幅提升"
- Expert references where relevant
- Concrete data points

### Step 5: Optimize Opening and Closing

**Opening Hook** (choose one approach):
1. **Pain Point**: "你是不是还在熬夜写周报？"
2. **Show Results**: Display impressive outcome immediately
3. **Create Suspense**: "很多人用了AI却没效果，是因为第一步就错了"

**Emotional Closing**:
- Connect technology back to human experience
- Reference memories or emotions
- Leave readers with warmth
- Example: "看着这个小片子，我想起了十岁那会儿..." (Looking at this, I remembered when I was ten...)

### Step 6: Formatting Recommendations

Suggest improvements for:

**Paragraph Structure**:
- Break long paragraphs (max 3-5 lines each)
- Remove complex sentences
- Use clear step-by-step formatting

**Visual Elements**:
- Emoji suggestions (🚀 🔥 🤖 💡 ✅ ❌)
- Bold key points
- Use bullet points and lists
- Add blank lines for visual breathing room

**Ellipsis Usage**:
- "。。。" for pauses, helplessness, or trailing thoughts
- Don't overuse

## Output Format

Provide polished content in this structure:

1. **Title Options** (3-5 variations with explanations)
2. **Polished Full Article** (complete refined version)
3. **Key Changes Summary**:
   - What was changed and why
   - Which techniques were applied
   - Formatting recommendations

4. **Before/After Highlights** (2-3 examples showing specific improvements)

## Constraints

- **Preserve original meaning**: Don't change core content or viewpoints
- **Maintain structure**: Keep the existing framework intact
- **No operations advice**: Don't suggest comment section tactics, posting times, or other platform operations
- **Requires existing draft**: Cannot create content from scratch
